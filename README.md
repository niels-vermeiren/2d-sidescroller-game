# 2d-sidescroller-game

A 2d platformer made with SDL. Avoid spikes and moving saws, shoot your enemies into oblivion and collect all the coins in the process.
I made 5 increasingly challenging levels. 

## Features
- Custom 2d engine and physics
- Obstacles such as saws or spikes that can move
- Skeleton enemy AI that attempts to hit you with its axe
- Mage AI that shoots bullets in the direction of the player
- Stab your enemies with your knife or shoot them with your laser gun
- Collecting all the coins makes the game more challenging
